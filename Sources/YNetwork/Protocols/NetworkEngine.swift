/// and asynchronously completes with the response and associated data upon success or else an error upon failure.

/// NetworkManager handles building the request, encoding the parameters, optionally encrypting data,
/// optionally decrypting the response, and decoding the data into business objects.
/// You may choose to implement your own NetworkEngine if your app will be using a different protocol, such
/// as WebRTC or something that communicates over UDP.
